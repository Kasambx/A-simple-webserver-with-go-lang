# go-lang-webserver
This is a sample project that demonstrates how to containerize a Go web server and deploy it on Kubernetes.

**Getting Started**  

Prerequisites  

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your system:

1.Docker  
2.Kubernetes (kubectl)  
3.G0-lang

Building the Container Image
To build the container image, run the following command:

Copy code  
docker build -t your-image-name:your-image-tag .  
This command will build a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag it with the specified name and tag.

**Pushing the Container Image to a Registry**  
To push the container image to a registry such as Docker Hub, run the following command:

bash  
Copy code  
"docker push your-username/your-image-name:your-image-tag"
Make sure to replace your-username, your-image-name, and your-image-tag with your desired values.

**Deploying the Container on Kubernetes**  
To deploy the container on Kubernetes, run the following command:  

Copy code  
"kubectl apply -f your-deployment.yaml  "
This command will create a Kubernetes deployment with the specified number of replicas.

**Exposing the Deployment as a Service**  
To expose the Kubernetes deployment as a service, run the following command:  

Copy code
"kubectl apply -f your-service.yaml"
This command will create a Kubernetes service with a load balancer that listens on port 80 and forwards traffic to port 8080 in the container.
